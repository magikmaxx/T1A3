# Statement of purpose and scope

## Name of Application: FinView (Finance View)

### Problem Identification

In our day to day lives it is quite easy to spend money and the next time we look at our bank accounts we ask ourselves “where did all of my money go?”. The technology we have today such as PayWave, Apple Pay, Google Pay, all make it easy for people to spend money without thinking about it. Being able to casually tap your card or smartphone onto a device, makes it easy for people to spend their income without keeping track of their finances. To help with that issue, a basic finance application was created.

### Description

FinView gives users the opportunity to better track their earnings and spending. FinView does this by showing the users where they have spent their money on, and it can also provide the user with a more detailed overview. Whether the user has spent money on social gatherings, groceries, bills, or rent they will be able to see where their biggest monthly spending is coming from. Creating or removing categories allows the user to tailor the application to their liking.

### Target Audience

The target audience for FinView is anyone who wants to better understand where they are spending their money. It can also help users determine where they can reduce spending. By breaking down the monthly spending into separate categories will clearly show the user how much they have spent for that specific category in that month.

### Interaction with FinView

FinView will first display a welcome message that explains to the user what FinView is and how it can benefit their daily lives. The user will be able to select different things in the Menu. The Menu includes:

1.  Enter current Balance
1.  Make changes to current balance
1.  View current balance
1.  View expenditure breakdown
1.  Create a category

When the user receives their wages or when they are required to pay a bill, they can easily enter those amounts into FinView and FinView will easily and calculate what the user has left. The user will have seamless experience with the app because it is intuitive and straight forward. The titles on the menu tell them exactly what each menu button does, and they will be guided step-by-step so that the experience and interaction they have with FinView is done with ease and without stress.

## Features

#### Enter current balance

This allows the user to enter their current balance and once they have entered their current balance it is saved. They will be able to choose what month they would like to enter their balance in.

#### Make changes to current balance

1. Add Balance
1. Subtract Balance

The user will be able to add to their current balance or subtract from their current balance. As above in “Enter current balance, the user will be able to select the month they would like to subtract or add a balance.

#### View Current balance

Viewing the current balance will show the user their current balance, where the entered balance is subtracted from their expenditure. This is a quick view which only shows them the balance without any kind of breakdown. To also make it easily recognizable whether they have a positive or negative balance, it will be shown in green or red respectively.

#### View expenditure breakdown

When the user selects this option, they will be able to see a breakdown of their expenses including their current balance.
When the user selects this, they will be able to see exactly in what categories they have spent the most and this can help them make better decisions on their spending habits. Just like in “view current balance”, any expenses are shown in red and any income or positive numbers are shown in green.

#### Create a category

Should there be a category that is not included in FinView, the user will be able to easily create their own category and this gives the user freedom, because they will not be restricted with the categories that FinView provides them. With greater flexibility, the user can better organize and makes sense of their finances due to better categorization.
